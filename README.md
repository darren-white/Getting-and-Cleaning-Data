Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
=========================

The script run_analysis.r will create a tidy data set of the mean and standard deviation measures in the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set. This is comprised of the following files:
  
	- activity_labels.txt
  
	- features.txt
  
	- subject_train.txt
  
	- X_train.txt
  
	- y_train.txt
  
	- subject_test.txt
  
	- X_test.txt



When executing run_analysis.r, the above files must be located in your working directory. The resulting tidy data set, aggMeasures.csv, will be written to your working directory.
